## Dataset Description

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state) and contains data on longitude and latitude of all countries in the world.


```r
dat <- read.csv("world_country_and_usa_states_latitude_and_longitude_values.csv")
```

The dataset is made of 245 rows and 8 columns containing
the names of every country in the world and their locations:


```r
library(knitr)
kable(head(dat))
```



|country_code | latitude|  longitude|country              |usa_state_code | usa_state_latitude| usa_state_longitude|usa_state  |
|:------------|--------:|----------:|:--------------------|:--------------|------------------:|-------------------:|:----------|
|AD           | 42.54624|   1.601554|Andorra              |AK             |           63.58875|          -154.49306|Alaska     |
|AE           | 23.42408|  53.847818|United Arab Emirates |AL             |           32.31823|           -86.90230|Alabama    |
|AF           | 33.93911|  67.709953|Afghanistan          |AR             |           35.20105|           -91.83183|Arkansas   |
|AG           | 17.06082| -61.796428|Antigua and Barbuda  |AZ             |           34.04893|          -111.09373|Arizona    |
|AI           | 18.22055| -63.068615|Anguilla             |CA             |           36.77826|          -119.41793|California |
|AL           | 41.15333|  20.168331|Albania              |CO             |           39.55005|          -105.78207|Colorado   |

We will then be interested only in the columns pertaining the latitude, longitude and country names. We will disregard codes and US related data.


```r
dat <- dat[,2:4]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We are interested in plotting only complete cases:


```r
complete <- complete.cases(dat)
```

There are 1 missing values in the dataset. We will however ignore them for the time being:


```r
dat <- dat[complete,]
```

## Data Visualisation

We can then visualise each country on the map:


```r
library(leaflet)
dat[,1:2] %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup=dat$country, clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions())
```
